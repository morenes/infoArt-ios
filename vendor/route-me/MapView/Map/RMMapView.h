/*! \mainpage Route-Me Map Framework 

\section intro_sec Introduction

Route-Me is an open source Objective-C framework for displaying maps on Cocoa Touch devices 
(the iPhone, and the iPod Touch). It was written in 2008 by Joseph Gentle as the basis for a transit
routing app. The transit app was not completed, because the government agencies involved chose not to release
the necessary data under reasonable licensing terms. The project was released as open source under the New BSD license (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) 
in September, 2008, and
is hosted on github (https://github.com/route-me/route-me).

 Route-Me provides a UIView subclass with a panning, zooming map. Zoom level, source of map data, map center,
 marker overlays, and path overlays are all supported.
 \section license_sec License
 Route-Me is licensed under the New BSD license.
 
 In any app that uses the Route-Me library, include the following text on your "preferences" or "about" screen: "Uses Route-Me map library, (c) 2008-2011 Route-Me Contributors". 
 
\section install_sec Installation

As Route-Me is undergoing some significant changes, the recommended course of action is to clone a copy of the repository: 
\verbatim
git clone git://github.com/route-me/route-me.git
\endverbatim

 There are three subdirectories - MapView, Proj4, and samples. Proj4 is a support class used to do map projections. The MapView project contains only the route-me map library. "samples" contains some ready-to-build projects which you may use as starting points for your own applications, and also some engineering test cases. samples/SampleMap and samples/ProgrammaticMap are the best places to look, to see how to embed a Route-Me map in your application.

 Also see https://github.com/route-me/route-me/wiki/Embedding-Guide
 
\section maps_sec Map Data
 
 Route-Me supports map data served from many different sources:
 - the Open Street Map project's server.
 - CloudMade, which provides commercial servers delivering Open Street Map data.
 - Microsoft Virtual Earth.
 - Open Aerial Map.
 - Yahoo! Maps.
 
 Each of these data sources has different license restrictions and fees. In particular, Yahoo! Maps are 
 effectively unusable in Route-Me due to their license terms; the Yahoo! access code is provided for demonstration
 purposes only.
 
 You must contact the data vendor directly and arrange licensing if necessary, including obtaining your own
 access key. Follow their rules.
 
 If you have your own data you'd like to use with Route-Me, serving it through your own Mapnik installation
 looks like the best bet. Mapnik is an open source web-based map delivery platform. For more information on
 Mapnik, see http://www.mapnik.org/ .

/*! 
 \brief Wrapper around RMMapContents for the iPhone.
 
 It implements event handling; but that's about it. All the interesting map
 logic is done by RMMapContents. There is exactly one RMMapView instance for each RMMapContents instance.
 
 A -forwardInvocation method exists for RMMap, and forwards all unhandled messages to the RMMapContents instance.
 
 \bug No accessors for enableDragging, enableZoom, deceleration, decelerationFactor. Changing enableDragging does not change multitouchEnabled for the view.
